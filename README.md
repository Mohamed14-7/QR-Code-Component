# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution for the **QR Code Component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
I built it using **pure HTML & CSS** with clean structure and Flexbox for perfect centering.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- The **card** is centered both vertically and horizontally using **Flexbox**.
- The **attribution** footer is fixed at the **bottom of the page** (without using position absolute).
- The design is **responsive** and clean.
- **BEM Methodology** is used for class naming for better scalability.
